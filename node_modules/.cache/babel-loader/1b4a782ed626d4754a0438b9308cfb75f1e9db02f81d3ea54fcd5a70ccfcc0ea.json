By storing the note data in the component's state, you can easily manage and update the notes within your application. This allows you to dynamically render the list of notes, update individual notes, or add new notes based on user interactions or application logic. Overall, including the `notes` property in the component's state sets up the initial data structure for managing notes within your application, providing a foundation for building out note-related functionality.\n\nexport default App;\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,aAAa;AAChC,OAAOC,SAAS,MAAM,gBAAgB;AACtC,SAASC,SAAS,QAAQ,OAAO;AAEjC,MAAMC,GAAG,SAASD,SAAS,CAAC;EAAAE,YAAA;IAAA,SAAAC,SAAA;IAAA,KAC1BC,KAAK,GAAG;MACNC,KAAK,EAAE,CACL;QACEC,EAAE,EAAEC,IAAI,CAACC,GAAG,CAAC,CAAC;QACdC,KAAK,EAAE,EAAE;QACTC,WAAW,EAAE,EAAE;QACfC,eAAe,EAAE;MACnB,CAAC,CACF;MAEDC,UAAU,EAAE;IACd,CAAC;IAED;IAEA;IACA;IACA;IAAA,KACAC,OAAO,GAAG,MAAM;MACd,MAAMC,OAAO,GAAG;QACdR,EAAE,EAAEC,IAAI,CAACC,GAAG,CAAC,CAAC;QACdC,KAAK,EAAE,EAAE;QACTC,WAAW,EAAE,EAAE;QACfC,eAAe,EAAE;MACnB,CAAC;MAED,MAAMI,QAAQ,GAAG,CAACD,OAAO,EAAE,GAAG,IAAI,CAACV,KAAK,CAACC,KAAK,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC;MACjD,IAAI,CAACW,QAAQ,CAAC;QAAEX,KAAK,EAAEU;MAAS,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC;IACtC,CAAC;IAED;IAAA,KACAE,MAAM,GAAG,CAACC,QAAQ,EAAEC,UAAU,EAAEC,YAAY,KAAK;MAC/C;MACA;MACA;MACA;;MAEA,MAAMC,YAAY,GAAG,IAAI,CAACjB,KAAK,CAACC,KAAK,CAACiB,GAAG,CAAEC,IAAI,IAAK;QAClD,IAAIA,IAAI,CAACjB,EAAE,KAAKY,QAAQ,EAAE;UACxB;UACA,OAAOK,IAAI;QACb,CAAC,MAAM;UACL,IAAIJ,UAAU,KAAK,OAAO,EAAE;YAC1BI,IAAI,CAACd,KAAK,GAAGW,YAAY;YACzB,OAAOG,IAAI;UACb,CAAC,MAAM;YACLA,IAAI,CAACb,WAAW,GAAGU,YAAY;YAC/B,OAAOG,IAAI;UACb;QACF;MACF,CAAC,CAAC;;MAEF;;MAEA,IAAI,CAACP,QAAQ,CAAC;QAAEX,KAAK,EAAEgB;MAAa,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC;IAC1C,CAAC;IAED;IAEA;IAEA;IACA;IAAA,KACAG,QAAQ,GAAIZ,UAAU,IAAK;MACzB,MAAMa,aAAa,GAAGb,UAAU,CAACc,WAAW,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC;;MAEhD,MAAMC,WAAW,GAAG,IAAI,CAACvB,KAAK,CAACC,KAAK,CAACiB,GAAG,CAAEC,IAAI,IAAK;QACjD;QACA,IAAI,CAACE,aAAa,EAAE;UAClBF,IAAI,CAACZ,eAAe,GAAG,IAAI;UAC3B,OAAOY,IAAI;QACb,CAAC,MAAM;UACL,MAAMd,KAAK,GAAGc,IAAI,CAACd,KAAK,CAACiB,WAAW,CAAC,CAAC,CAACE,QAAQ,CAACH,aAAa,CAAC;UAC9D,MAAMf,WAAW,GAAGa,IAAI,CAACb,WAAW,CACjCgB,WAAW,CAAC,CAAC,CACbE,QAAQ,CAACH,aAAa,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC;UAC5B,MAAMI,UAAU,GAAGpB,KAAK;UACxB,MAAMqB,YAAY,GAAGpB,WAAW;UAChC,MAAMqB,QAAQ,GAAGF,UAAU,IAAIC,YAAY,CAAC,CAAC;UAC7CP,IAAI,CAACZ,eAAe,GAAGoB,QAAQ,CAAC,CAAC;UACjC,OAAOR,IAAI;QACb;;QAEA;QACA;QACA;MACF,CAAC,CAAC;MAEF,IAAI,CAACP,QAAQ,CAAC;QAAEX,KAAK,EAAEsB,WAAW;QAAEf,UAAU,EAAEa;MAAc,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC;IACpE,CAAC;IAED;IAAA,KACAO,UAAU,GAAIC,WAAW,IAAK;MAC5B,MAAMC,cAAc,GAAIX,IAAI,IAAKA,IAAI,KAAKU,WAAW,CAAC,CAAC;MACvD,MAAME,UAAU,GAAG,IAAI,CAAC/B,KAAK,CAACC,KAAK,CAAC+B,MAAM,CAACF,cAAc,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC;;MAE5D,IAAI,CAAClB,QAAQ,CAAC;QAAEX,KAAK,EAAE8B;MAAW,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC;IACxC,CAAC;IAAA,KAEDE,UAAU,GAAIC,CAAC,IAAK,IAAI,CAACtB,QAAQ,CAAC;MAAEX,KAAK,EAAEiC,CAAC,CAACC,MAAM,CAACC;IAAM,CAAC,CAAC;EAAA;EAC5DC,iBAAiBA,CAAA,EAAG;IAClB,MAAMC,OAAO,GAAGC,YAAY,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,SAAS,CAAC;IAC/C,IAAIF,OAAO,EAAE;MACX,MAAMG,SAAS,GAAGC,IAAI,CAACC,KAAK,CAACL,OAAO,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC;MACvC,IAAI,CAAC1B,QAAQ,CAAC6B,SAAS,CAAC;IAC1B;EACF;EAEAG,kBAAkBA,CAAA,EAAG;IACnB,MAAMN,OAAO,GAAGI,IAAI,CAACG,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI,CAAC7C,KAAK,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC;IAC5CuC,YAAY,CAACO,OAAO,CAAC,SAAS,EAAER,OAAO,CAAC;EAC1C;EAEAS,MAAMA,CAAA,EAAG;IACP,oBACEtD,KAAA,CAAAuD,aAAA;MAAAC,MAAA;MAAAC,QAAA;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA;IAAA,gBACE7D,KAAA,CAAAuD,aAAA,CAACtD,MAAM;MACL0B,QAAQ,EAAE,IAAI,CAACA,QAAS,CAAC;MAAA;MACzBZ,UAAU,EAAE,IAAI,CAACR,KAAK,CAACQ,UAAW;MAClCC,OAAO,EAAE,IAAI,CAACA,OAAQ;MAAAwC,MAAA;MAAAC,QAAA;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA;IAAA,CACvB,CAAC,eACF7D,KAAA,CAAAuD,aAAA,CAACrD,SAAS;MACRkB,MAAM,EAAE,IAAI,CAACA,MAAO;MACpBZ,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI,CAACD,KAAK,CAACC,KAAM;MACxB2B,UAAU,EAAE,IAAI,CAACA,UAAW;MAC5B2B,QAAQ,EAAE,IAAI,CAACtB,UAAW,CAAC;MAAA;MAAAgB,MAAA;MAAAC,QAAA;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA;IAAA,CAC5B,CACE;IACL;IACA;IACA;IACA;IACA;IAAA;EAEJ;AACF;;AAEA;;AAEA,eAAezD,GAAG","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
